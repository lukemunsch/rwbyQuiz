## Overview

The RWBY Fan-Made Quiz is designed for people to have fun testing their knowledge of the Remnant universe and the characters that they have fallen in love with or hate completely.

The quiz is intended to give the user a brief (and occasionally funny) answer set to questions about events/people/places they have met/visited within the story told about Ruby Rose and her collection of Huntsmen. They can run the quiz multiple times to see how they fare against a randomly assigned set of questions.

## User Stories

On the user's first visit to my Quiz site, this will allow the user to test the site and try out their knowledge. They can appreciate the aesthetic of the page and how they link to the main themes and colors of the RWBY show.

On the second and all further visits to the RWBY Fan-Made Quiz, they will test their knowledge further with a series of randomly assigned questions that will differ every time they are running the quiz: the number of questions to answer is 20 and the lifelines add extra points depending on how many lives are remaining. The randomly selected questions will be chosen from the over 60 available, so they may be able to run the quiz 3 times with only occasional repeats.

## Features

Languages used for the RWBY Fan-Made Quiz are HTML, CSS AND JavaScript.

### Style Choices

Using some of the main logo images and personal experience from viewing the show myself;
- I have styled the quiz pages and elements using the themes of the main RWBY team with the prominent theme being Ruby Rose (the main protagonist for the show and leader of team RWBY) in black and red buttons and highlights. 
- The answer buttons are shown in the 4 main character colors: Ruby - red, Weiss - white, Blake - black (dark elements), and Yang - yellow. 
- The text color is supposed to represent the blade color for Crescent Rose (the large scythe weapon).

### Favicon

As the most iconic weapon in the RWBY universe, I have chosen Crescent Rose as the favicon.ico to represent the site in the browser tab. This is the main protagonist's weapons and will also feature in the site as the lifeline counter

### Index page

This is the Entry page for the RWBY Quiz - the first page that allows users to enter the actual quiz.
- Headed by the main logo for RWBY and a smaller design when the screen responds to the smaller widths.
- The main protagonist's icon of Red Rose (for Ruby Rose), used to enter the quiz along with the text below just in case the icon fails to load.
- The footer, which is fixed to the bottom of the page, has two pieces of text (or one if the screen size is too small) with simple text.

### About Modal

The initial modal pop-up that I created is for the 'about' section which gives the users a brief explanation of what the site is about. It is simply filled with text elements and a button to make the pop-up close once you are done reading it. I considered changing the code for the site completely at the start but the pop-up approach made it seem tidier and doesn't affect the rest of the page, only showing and hiding the relevant content.

The style of the pop-up is in a similar style scheme to the rest of the site and elements with reds and light gray writing with the button in black with same color writing as the body.

### Game Page

The game page is the main page that contains the quiz itself. Elements for the nav and modal buttons similar to the first page with red background color, black writing and silver border block on the left.

There is a question section with similar styling to the footer element on the index page with its red border, dark red background and lightgray writing.

The 4 buttons are all black background with light gray writing. The edges of the buttons are in the colors of the iconic team colors; red for Ruby, white for Weiss, black (dark gray to stand out from the background) for Blake and yellow for Yang. I have not included a footer for this page as I didn't feel the need for it.

I also use the iconic weapon Crescent Rose (Ruby Rose's scythe - it's also a gun!) as a lifeline counter as a small tribute to the main character as well. This is also in a similar color scheme to the rest of the site; each one disappearing when an incorrect answer is selected.

### Rules, Success and Game Over Modal

I have borrowed the same style for the About modal to style the other pop-ups screens that appear; the Rules with only simple text, the Success and Game Over screens with small images that show Team RWBY to have another go if you succeed and the face of the main villain Salem if you lose all three lives.

## Implementation

The main page is the entry to the entire site; 
- Simple image to show the iconic image fomr the subject show.
- Simple button top right to explain what the page is about.
- Iconic logo of main protagonist as entry to the main quiz page with explanation text.
- Minimalistic footer with simple text so as not to ditract from main topic buttons and features.

The game page is consisting of most of the elements and functions as well as modals and styles;
- Direction back to the main home page in top left.
- Restarting the quiz and a rules pop up that appears and disappears when relevant buttons are clicked.
- Question Area with simple contracting colors and auto populating using JavaScript. 
- Answer buttons that bring up corresponding answers depending on the question that is asked.

The images for the pages were found and located on google searches (pages credited at bottom of README.md file), and though the files were not large, I have compressed the images and logos to better load quicker and improve the performance of the site.

## Features to Implement

- The main feature I would like to have implemented is a leaderboard to show all the poeple and their relevant scores, keeping it limited to the top 10 scorers. My decision to remove it came when I relised that if you succeeed then everyone would have the same 3 scores; 18, 21 or 25.

- Some quiz pages I looked at show there is a timer involved to help keep the quiz moving swiftly. My decision NOT to include it in mine came from the desire to let people view all the answers and get a feel for all the options; I included some comedy answers as well as some show-relevant info that may not be specifically relevant to the question asked but might still allow some insite to different characters/places/scenarios.

## Testing

The quiz has been put through validator checks to confirm that there are no issues with the code. I have also been using the dev Tools in Chrome browser to inspect certain code to make sure they are operating correctly and elements displaying properly. The code has been passed through validators for the HTML and CSS - the green line at the bottom of the images showing that the code contains no errors. I have provided screenshots below to confirm the results of the validator checks.

Along with validators, I have passed the quiz through multiple different devices and linked it to social media for other people to try and test the site; making sure answers are correct as well as the functions are called correctly at appropriate times. On different devices and by different users, no issues were reported.

## Unfixed Bugs

Originally I had a separate leaderboard modal with a submit button for usernames and their relevant scores. Though I managed to style the modal, and then decided on a separate page to display the results. But I was unable to fix the bug where the correct score would be pushed to the scorer array. So rather than have a broken page with no results displaying correctly, I have removed the section and continued to look into this in case I decide to include it at a later date.

I have an issue regarding the buttons themselves; the internal content is only the space of the word, and yet when the rest of the button is clicked, no action happens. I have tried to increase the size of the field and width of the element itself, but it doesn't change the clickable area for the buttons. I have looked at trying to change the target for the clickable function to see if that makes a difference.

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

#### Forking Repositories

To propose fixing changes to some code, or to use the code as a starting point for your own project, you can fork the repository by clicking the 'Fork' button in the top right hand corner of the Github repository page.

#### Cloning Repositories

To clone a repository to use in your own project you can:
- Click on the 'Code' button next to the gitpod link which will bring down a dropdown menu, from there either:
    - Clone the repository by copying the link for the repo and using it for your own project,
    - Downloading the zip of the file to use for your own project.


### Remote Deployment

Whether you have cloned, forked, downloaded an existing repository or created your own repository, you can deploy your code to the web from your repository page. To complete this, you can:
1. Navigate to settings (upper right of the page).
2. On the left, navigate downwards to the Pages section.
3. When the page loads there would be a dropdown in main section of page, choose main/master.
4. Hit Save and wait for link to show as: "Your site is published at 
https://<'your-github-repo'>.github.io/rwbyQuiz/"


## Credits

In the beginning of the JavaScript section of my project, I created numerous versions of my code but I couldn't make the code complete what I wanted it to. I have built on and adapted the code to fix the issues with my own quiz. The main video I used was James Q Quick's video on youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdQGs62cR8 is the video for fixing the issues I had with my quiz code and helped me understand what my code was trying to become. Through my research, I have managed to find an example of a quiz site that I based the structure on to help build my site. I borrowed some code that he also used for his quiz as I struggled to link the answers to the corresponding buttons, but it has been adapted and changed for my own project:

    answers.forEach( answer => {
            const number = answer.dataset.answer;
            answer.innerText = currentQuestion['answer' + number];
        });

    answers.forEach(answer => {
    answer.addEventListener('click', e => {

            if(!answerRequired) return;

            answerRequired = false;
            const selectedOption = e.target;





I did have a few issues with a pop-up modal that failed to appear and disappear with the clicking of certain elements but another user called Dean Andrejevic was able to assist me. Together we were able to resolve the issue and made the modals appear as necessary.

I was also having trouble with my lifeline icons not disappearing - and then once they did, not reappearing when the quiz restarted - and together with my mentor, Chris Quinn, I was able to adapt my code and identify the issues with targeting my specific elements and then making sure the elements were styled correctly in the start game function. The code i finally managed to come up with was:

    let loseLife = document.body.querySelector(`.lifeline[data-life="${lifeLost}"]`);
    loseLife.setAttribute('style', 'display:none');
