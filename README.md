## Overview

The RWBY Fan-Made Quiz is designed for people to have fun testing their knowledge of the Remnant 
universe and the characters that they have fallen in love or hate with.

The quiz is intended to give the user a brief (and occasionally funny) answer set to questions 
about events/people/places they have met/visited within the story told about Ruby Rose and 
her collection of Huntsmen. They can run the quiz multiple times in order to see how they 
fare against a randomly assigned set of questions.

## User Stories

On the user's first visit to my Quiz site, this will allow the user to test the site and 
try out their knowledge. They can appreciate the aesthetic of the page and how they link 
to the main themes and colors of the RWBY show.

On the second and all further visits to the RWBY Fan-Made Quiz, they will test their knowledge 
further with a series of randomly assigned questions that will differ every time they are 
running the quiz: the number of questions to answer are 20 and the life lines add extra points 
depending on how many lives are remaining.

## Features

### Style Choices

Using some of the main logo images and personal experience from viewing the show myself;
- I have styled the quiz pages and elements using the themes of the main RWBY team with 
the prominant theme being Ruby Rose (the main protagonsit for the show and leader of 
team RWBY) in black and red buttons and highlights. 
- The answer buttons are shown in the 4 main character colors: Ruby - red, Weiss - white, 
Blake - black (dark elements), and Yang - yellow. 
- The text color is supposed to represent the blade color for Crescent Rose (the large 
scythe weapon).

### favicon

As the most iconic weapon in the RWBY universe, I have chosen Crescent Rose as the 
favicon.ico to represent the site in the browser tab. 

### Game page

This is the Entry page for the RWBY Quiz - the first page that allows user to enter 
the actual quiz.
- Headed by the main logo for RWBY and a smaller design when the screen responds 
to the smaller widths.
- The main protagonists icon of Red Rose (for Ruby Rose), used to enter the quiz 
along with the text below just in case the icon fails to load.
- The footer which is fixd to the bottom of the page as to peices of text (or one 
if the screen size is too small) with simple text.

## Credits

In the beginnging of the JavaScript section of my project I created numerous versions of my code but I coulnd't make the code compelete what I wanted it to. I have researched using some videos online and found some very helpful tutorials on code. The main video I used was James Q Quick's video on youtube for building a quiz app. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdQGs62cR8 is the video for fixing the issues I had with my app code.

I did have a few issues with a pop up moda that failed to appear and disappear with the clicking of certain elements but another user called Dean Andrejevic was able to assist me
