## Overview

The RWBY Fan-Made Quiz is designed for people to have fun testing their knowledge of the Remnant 
universe and the characters that they have fallen in love or hate with.

The quiz is intended to give the user a brief (and occasionally funny) answer set to questions 
about events/people/places they have met/visited within the story told about Ruby Rose and 
her collection of Huntsmen. They can run the quiz multiple times in order to see how they 
fare against a randomly assigned set of questions.

## User Stories

On the user's first visit to my Quiz site, this will allow the user to test the site and 
try out their knowledge. They can appreciate the aesthetic of the page and how they link 
to the main themes and colors of the RWBY show.

On the second and all further visits to the RWBY Fan-Made Quiz, they will test their knowledge 
further with a series of randomly assigned questions that will differ every time they are 
running the quiz: the number of questions to answer are 20 and the life lines add extra points 
depending on how many lives are remaining.

## Features

### Style Choices

Using some of the main logo images and personal experience from viewing the show myself;
- I have styled the quiz pages and elements using the themes of the main RWBY team with the prominant theme being Ruby Rose (the main protagonsit for the show and leader of team RWBY) in black and red buttons and highlights. 
- The answer buttons are shown in the 4 main character colors: Ruby - red, Weiss - white, Blake - black (dark elements), and Yang - yellow. 
- The text color is supposed to represent the blade color for Crescent Rose (the large scythe weapon).

### favicon

As the most iconic weapon in the RWBY universe, I have chosen Crescent Rose as the favicon.ico to represent the site in the browser tab.
